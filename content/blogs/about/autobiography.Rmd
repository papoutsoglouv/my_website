## Early life

My name is Vasileios and I am 22 years old. I was born in Athens, Greece but spent the largest part of my childhood in a beautiful little city called Volos. For the 99% of you who have never heard of Volos, please see a city photo taken from mountain Pelion above:

And one of the promenade:

```

## My education

I spent 3 years in Frankfurt where I did my undergrad at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. My time in Germany taught me that if I managed to learn German, anything is possible. Wanting to get a more international experience, I spent four months in the US, studying at University of Pennsylvania where I did my exchange semester. At the moment, I am reading for the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School.

## My Work

During the past four years, I have gained practical experience in m&a, restructuring, IPOs, and acquisition financing. I have worked at Commerzbank, PwC and BNP Paribas in Frankfurt, and AXIA Ventures in Athens.
