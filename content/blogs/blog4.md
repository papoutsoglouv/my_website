title: Gilead Sciences - Investment Recommendation
---


During my exchange semester at Wharton School, I took FNCE 207 - Corporate Valuation. That course kept me up many nights doing the DCF for a Biotech Company specializing in areas of unmet need, among other projects. It was my initiation into the Healthcare sector and since then my interest has remained unchanged. For that reason, this project has a special meaning for me. 

Please follow the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r-Bd6k6wV2mMyqgiwJKefFlL0_TrrXE_) to see the investment recommendation presentation.
