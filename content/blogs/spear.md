title: Spearfishing in Greece

Whenever I do summer vacation, I always try to sneak some time for spearfishing. Diving up to 10-15 meters, I can see different kinds of fish and the beautiful sea bottom. At the time, the sea tends to be really relaxing and a getaway to any problem, concern or negative thought. After 5 hours in the sea, the sense of accomplishment for diving deep, getting some fish, and exaggerating in the stories you tell to friends and family about the fish you encountered and almost shot, its all worth it.
